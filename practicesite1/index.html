<h1>Hi friends, WELCOME to my page. </h1> 
I was born in Iran, and I moved to the states when I was 10 years old. I am currently majoring in Computational and Data Science. 
I work full time and study full time, so my plate is somewhat full. But I still make sure I make sure to make time to travel and enjoy life. We all know time flies. 
My travels have shaped who I am today, I cannot wait for my next adventure.
