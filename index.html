											<p>WHY IS THIS WEBSITE IMPORTANT TO VENOUS?</p>
										</header>
										<p>When you create a professional profile, blog or website, it's important to help friends or potential employers form a personal connection. This is because personal connections can help individuals learn more about me and potentially increase their interest in my skills, experiences or education. Reviewing "my expertise" can help you understand and build your own compelling summary of skills, accomplishments, and their view of today's world.</p>

											<h3>The Alhambra - Granada, Spain</h3>
											<p>Nestled among a mountainous region in the south of Spain, this picturesque palace and fortress complex has a storied history. The Alhambra was built in 889 on top of ancient Roman ruins, only to be neglected until the 13th century, when it was rebuilt by an emir of the Nasrid dynasty. </p>

											<h3>Stonehenge - Salisbury, England</h3>
											<p>While you can no longer enter inside the stone circle at Stonehenge, you can still get pretty close to one of the world's most famous megalithic structures. Located in the midst of a large series of prehistoric earthworks, the Salisbury-adjacent structure includes hundreds of burial mounds. The precise origin and function of Stonehenge remains hotly debated to this day.</p>

											<h3>Delphi - Mount Parnassus, Greece</h3>
											<p>Greece and Italy have so many famous ruins that it can be hard to choose from among them. While the go-to locations for most modern day adventurers are places like the Parthenon in Greece or the Colosseum in Rome, Delphi is sometimes forgotten, even though it housed the most famed oracle of the ancient world.</p>

											<h3>Neuschwanstein Castle - Schwangau, Germany</h3>
											<p>When you try to picture a fairytale castle, chances are what appears in your mind is something similar to Neuschwanstein Castle. That's not by accident, as the castle actually served as the inspiration for Disney's Sleeping Beauty Castle. Originally built by King Ludwig II, the castle was first opened to the public just seven weeks after his death in 1886. The picturesque structure is perched on the top of a tall hill in Bavaria, Germany.</p>
